# Collections
# They store multiple values. They are like variables but can hold many individual values
# There are 4 main collection types:
#                  1. Lists
#                  2. Dictionaries
#                  3. Tuples
#                  4. Sets


# Tuple -> This is an ordered unchangeable collection of data

# Dictionary -> A collection of key-value pairs

# Sets -> An unordered collection of data that does not contain any duplicate
