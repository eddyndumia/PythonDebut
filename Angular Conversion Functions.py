# This sector focuses on the angular section of mathematics and degrees
# A degree is a unit of measurement in mathematics
# There are 180 degrees in a straight line
# There are 360 degrees in a circle
# A radian is a degree times 180 divided by pi

import math

radians = 1.5
radians_to_dg = math.degrees(1.5)  # This will convert radians to degrees
print(radians_to_dg)

dg_to_radians = math.radians(radians_to_dg)  # This will convert degrees to radians
print(dg_to_radians)
